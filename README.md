![image_text](images/NEC-DGT.png)
This repository is the official Tensorflow implementation of NEC-DGT, a multi-attributed graph translation model.

The relevant paper is ["Deep Multi-attributed Graph Translation with Node-Edge Co-evolution"](http://mason.gmu.edu/~lzhao9/materials/papers/ICDM_2019_NEC_DGT-final.pdf).

## Installation
Install Tensorflow following the instuctions on the official website. The code has been tested over Tensorflow 1.13.1 version.

## Datasets

The dataset can be found and downloaded at [Datasets for Deep Graph Translation](https://github.com/xguo7/Dataset-for-Deep-Graph-Translation). The datasets used here are IoT datasets, B-A datasets, and E-R datasets.

For directly using datasets to run the code without modifying the format, please find datasets [here](https://exchangelabsgmu-my.sharepoint.com/:f:/g/personal/xguo7_masonlive_gmu_edu/EjeDXlB-jEZJhgnGOjPhqoIB95eEaeiOOQRNSvZswwmkzQ?e=ZULOhr).

## Code Description

There are four experiment tasks: synthetic1, synthetic2, Molecule (reactaction prediction) and IoT malware confinement.
For each experiment task: `main.py` is the main executable file which includes specific arguments and training iterations and calls `model.py` and `utlis.py`. `utlis.py` is where the dataset is read.


## Run the code
For each task, to train a model,edit the FLAGS "--type" to "train" and:

               python main.py
               
               
to test a model,edit the FLAGS "--type" to "test" and:

               python main.py             

## Outputs
There are several different outputs to store the generated edges and nodes.

`O_t.npy` contains the nodes attributes of the generated target graphs.

`O_x.npy` contains the nodes attributes of the input graphs.

`O_y.npy` contains the nodes attributes of the real target graphs.

`Ra_t.npy` contains the edge attributes of the generated target graphs.

`Ra_x.npy` contains the edge attributes of the input graphs.

`Ra_y.npy` contains the edge attributes of the real target graphs.


## Evaluation
The evaluation is atomatically done and print out at the end of the test process.
